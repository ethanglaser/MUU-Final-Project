# MUU-Final-Project
This project involves using NYC citibike data to analyze the flow of bike traffic from the busiest stations in the morning and evening for a given month, the data of which can be downloaded (here)[https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html] for July 2021. The *warmup.py* file involves some simple data exploration before jumping into the heavy part of the project. *exploration.py* and the various notebooks all contribute to the step-by-step completion of the project and creation of Markov Chain transition heatmaps, stationary distributions, and expectations for different stations at different times of day using sampling intervals of 5 and 10 minutes.
